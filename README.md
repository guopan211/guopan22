Clash of Clans
Clash of Clans - Crypto is a blockchain-based online strategy game developed by the development team of the Finnish game company Supercell Oy. Supercell Oy is a game studio founded by Ilkka Paananen and five other co-founders in 2010, headquartered in Finland. In November 2012, the company surpassed EA to become the game publisher with the most revenue in the App Store, and it relied on only two games: Hay Day and Clash Of Clans. Among them, Clash of Clans has occupied the top three positions in the App Store game revenue rankings for more than half a year. Relying on only two mobile games, the company's revenue has grown rapidly from 700,000 US dollars per month to 2.5 million US dollars in daily revenue, creating a precedent for mobile game developers. In 2021, the team decided to launch a chain game version to welcome the future meta-universe world and jointly create meta-universe infrastructure.
